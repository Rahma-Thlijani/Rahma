# Anticipating Youtube Videos' Views 
Data science project that uses deep learning and multiple linear regression aiming to predict the number of views for youtube videos.
## Data Description
We have two datasets in this project: "StatsVideosXALL.csv" (for the features) and "StatsVideosXALL.csv" (for the output).
The datasets has 3365 rows and 4 columns: Likes, Dislikes, Subscribers and Views, they related to each youtube video. 
## Project Overview
In this project will apply supervised learning techniques on youtube data to predict the number of views of a video considering multiple features. 
To accomplish this, we will compare 2 models: Multiple Linear Regression and Deep Neural Network. In addition, we will evaluate each model based on the MAE
the RMSE and the R2_Score.
## Project Steps
You will first understand the data the we will apply data exploration. Afterwards, we will train two different models and finally we will evaluate them.
All the project steps are organized and listed below:
1. Data Understanding
2. Data Exploration
3. Multiple Regression Model
3.1 Model Training
3.2 Model Prediction
3.3 Model Evaluation
4. Deep Learning Model
4.1 Model Training
4.2 Model Prediction  
4.3 Model Evaluation   
## Conclusion / Results
Two different learning algorithms (Multiple Linear Regression and Deep Neural Network) were tested, and we have evaluated their performance.
The best prediction performance was achieved with the Deep Neural Network model, and resulted in the following metrics:

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 12317109.74
* Root mean squared error (RMSE): 56406118.44
* R-squared Score (R2_Score): 0.8038
